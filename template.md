Who am I?
---------

A brief description of who you are, and the name of the project for which you
use Dask.


The Problem I'm trying to solve
-------------------------------

Include context and detail here about the problem that you're trying to solve.
Details are *very* welcome here.  You're probably writing to someone within
your own field so feel free to use technical speech.

You shouldn't mention Dask here yet; focus on your problem instead.  Why is it
important?  Why is it hard?  Who does this problem affect?


How Dask helps
--------------

Describe how Dask helps you to solve this problem.  Again, details are welcome.
New readers probably won't know about specific API like "we use client.scatter"
but probably will be able to follow terms used as headers in documentation like
"we used dask dataframe and the futures interface together".

We also encourage you to mention how your use of Dask has *changed* over time.
What originally drew you to the project?  Is that still why you use it or has
your perception or needs changed?


Pain points when using dask
---------------------------

Dask has issues and it's not always the right solution for every problem.  What
are things that you ran into that you think others in your field should know
ahead of time?


Technology I use around Dask
----------------------------

This might be other libraries that you use with Dask for analysis or data
storage, cluster technologies that you use to deploy or capture logs, etc..
Anything that you think someone like you might want to use alongside Dask.


Other information
-----------------

Is there something else that didn't fit into the sections above?  Feel free to
make your own.


Links
-----

Links throughout the document are good.  You may want to list them again here.
This might be links to your company or project, links to blogposts or notebooks
that you've written about the topic, or links to relevant source code.
Anything that someone who was interested in your story could use to learn more.
